#**Intelligent Disease Diagnosis and Prevention System Using Machine Learning**
This project leverages machine learning and symptom analysis to predict diseases and suggest preventive measures. <br>
Using a Decision Tree Classifier, it analyzes user-input symptoms and provides accurate predictions along with recommended medications and precautions.<br>
The system is built with Flask for web deployment and includes data preprocessing techniques like SMOTE and Label Encoding to enhance model performance.

**Key Features:**
- AI-driven disease prediction
- Real-time symptom-based analysis
- Flask-based web interface
- Medication & precaution recommendations

The goal is to improve healthcare accessibility by offering instant, reliable disease diagnosis using AI.
